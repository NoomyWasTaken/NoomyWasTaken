# 👋 hey, i'm **noomy**  
### AI Software Engineer • Full-Stack Builder • MedTech / Imaging • Data & Infra Nerd

I ship end-to-end products where **AI meets real users** — from pipelines → inference → UI → deployment.  
**Introverted. Logical. Dry humor.** ☕🚫 **Tea** ✅

## ⚡ TL;DR
- 🧠 Build AI features that **actually work in production** (not just notebooks)
- 🩺 Currently deep in **medical imaging workflows** (DICOM, viewers, model serving)
- 🧰 Love clean architecture, strong docs, automation, and “make it reproducible” energy
- ♟️ Puzzles, chess, Rubik’s cubes, systems thinking, and comfy UI details

---

## 🧩 What I’m into
**Core themes**
- Applied ML + product engineering  
- Medical imaging + clinical UX (DICOM tooling, viewers, segmentation/metrics)
- Data engineering patterns, RAG/LLM workflows, and retrieval systems
- DevOps/infra (containerization, orchestration, repeatable deployments)

**Vibes**
- calm, monotone, low-noise, high-signal  
- dry jokes, clean commits, and README-driven development

---

## 🧠 Toolbox
### Languages
- **Python**, **TypeScript/JavaScript**, **C/C++**, **SQL**, *(plus whatever gets the job done)*

### AI / Data
- **PyTorch**, MONAI/MONAI Label (medical AI workflows)
- Inference pipelines, metrics, model integration, dataset tooling
- NLP/RAG pipelines (retrieval + ranking + evaluation)

### Backend / APIs
- Node.js (**NestJS**), REST/GraphQL (**Apollo**), Auth flows
- PostgreSQL, TypeORM, scalable service design

### Frontend
- **React + TypeScript**, TailwindCSS, state management patterns, UX polish
- Viewer integration (e.g., OHIF-style ecosystems)

### Infra / DevOps
- **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **NGINX**, **Terraform**, CI/CD
- GPU-aware workloads (CUDA ecosystems, perf tuning mindset)

## 🧪 What I’m focusing on right now
- Making ML pipelines **boringly reliable** (tests, monitoring, eval, reproducibility)
- Sharpening infra patterns for AI apps (GPU-aware deployments, orchestration)
- Building interfaces that feel **fast, calm, and obvious** — no clutter, no drama

---

## 🏆 Strengths I’m known for
- Turning messy real-world requirements into clean systems
- Shipping across the stack without losing the plot
- Documentation that makes future-me (and teammates) feel loved
- Debugging with patience + a slightly suspicious expression
